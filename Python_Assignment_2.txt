1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans. Two values of Boolean data type are true and false. They are written as "True" and "False.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans. AND, OR and NOT

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans. AND Table                   OR Table                            NOT Table
     x    y     o/p              x     y      o/p                    x    o/p
     True True  True             True  True   True                  True  False 
     False False False           True False   True                  False True
     True False False            False True   True 
     False True False            False False  False 
     
     x and y are variables and o/p is the output.

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
Ans. False
     False
     True
     False
     False
     True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans. >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans. "=" is an assignment operator while "==" is a comparison operator. "=" operator is used when we want to assign some value to a variable while "==" operator is used when we want to compare 2 values.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
Ans.    spam = 0
	if spam == 10:
		print('eggs')			#Block A
		if spam > 5:			
			print('bacon')		#Block B
		else:
			print('ham')		#Block C
		print('spam')
	print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans. 
spam = int(input())
if spam == 1:
	print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
	print("Howdy")
else:
	print("Greetings!")

9. If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ans. CTRL + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans. The main difference between both the statements is that when break keyword comes, it terminates the execution of the current loop and passes the control over the next loop or main body, whereas when continue keyword is encountered, it skips the current iteration and executes the very next iteration in the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans. range(10), range(0,10) and range(1,10,1) - all will print same output as by default the start value is 0 and step value is 1.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans. 
FOR LOOP PROGRAM:
for i in range(1,11):
	print(i)

WHILE LOOP PROGRAM:
i=1
while i<=10:
	print(i)
	i = i+1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
Ans. The function can be called as spam.bacon()
